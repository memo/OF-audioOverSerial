openFrameworks (007) source code for old school serial communication over audio. i.e. encode text or any binary data into a stereo audio signal.

Demo video coming soon.

Written for and used on imogen heaps twitter dress for the 2010 Grammy awards.

Left channel carries the data encoded as binary. Right channel is the clock (i.e. every time the right channel crosses zero, indicates a new bit of information on the left channel).

Works on desktop and iphone (and perhaps android, but not tested).
